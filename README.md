## Abstract

Scalable dual-arm control represents a critical bottleneck in general-purpose robotics. While realizing emergent capabilities is essential for mastering complex dual-arm manipulation, deployment across diverse scenes is still constrained by limited adaptability and fragmented evaluation frameworks. To address these challenges, we present **RoboKino**, a novel simulation benchmark that introduces a unified paradigm for rigorously assessing dual-arm policies, leveraging domain-randomized task diversification and high-fidelity data synthesis. 

RoboKino designs five dual-arm atomic controllers that can be composed into collaborative complex tasks, alongside a standardized dataset of over 1,000 trajectories compliant with LeRobot v2.1 and augmented by 500 reusable interactive assets. Its integrated data acquisition, training, and inference pipeline enables robust policy generalization under realistic sensory inputs, including proprioceptive and visual observations that mirror Aloha-style hardware. 

Extensive empirical validation demonstrates that RoboKino significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in task completion efficacy and adaptability, establishing a solid foundation for scalable robotic systems and ensuring community-wide reproducibility.
